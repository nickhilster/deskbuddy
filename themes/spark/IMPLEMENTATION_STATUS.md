## Phase 3: Integration & Testing ⏳ PENDING

### Setup Checklist
- [ ] APNG files created and deployed to `themes/spark/assets/`
- [ ] theme.json verified for correct file paths
- [ ] Figma design file archived or referenced
- [ ] Color consistency validated across all animations
- [ ] Frame timings tested and tuned

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Idle state** — Eyes track cursor, animations loop smoothly
- [ ] **Thinking** — Head tilts, confused expression
- [ ] **Working (1 session)** — Watches intently, eyes follow action
- [ ] **Working (2 sessions)** — Nods along rhythmically
- [ ] **Working (3+ sessions)** — Amazed reaction, hands up
- [ ] **Juggling (1)** — Playful bouncing
- [ ] **Juggling (2+)** — Dizzy, spinning eyes
- [ ] **Error** — Concerned expression, tears
- [ ] **Attention (Success)** — Celebrates, jumps
- [ ] **Notification** — Alert eyes, points
- [ ] **Sleeping** — Peaceful, breathing, ZZZ
- [ ] **Waking** — Yawns, stretches, wakes up
- [ ] **Click reactions** — All 3 click types respond correctly
- [ ] **Drag reactions** — Left/right drags have distinct responses
- [ ] **Mini mode** — All 8 mini states display at screen edge
- [ ] **Sleep sequence** — Full 60+ second progression works

### User Feedback
- [ ] Visual polish — Do animations feel smooth and expressive?
- [ ] Personality — Does Spark feel playful and mischievous?
- [ ] Responsiveness — Do reactions feel immediate and fun?
- [ ] Balance — Is Spark complimentary to the robot, not distracting?

## How to Proceed

### Option A: Manual APNG Creation (Recommended for Control)
1. Use the 8 SVG files as keyframe references
2. Create frame variations in design software (Aseprite, GIMP, etc.)
3. Export as APNG using ffmpeg or online tools
4. Deploy to `themes/spark/assets/`

### Option B: Programmatic Generation
1. Write a script to:
   - Read each SVG file
   - Generate frame variations (pupil movement, rotation, etc.)
   - Export as PNG frames
   - Convert frame sequence to APNG
2. Batch generate all 32 animations

### Option C: AI-Assisted Art Generation
1. Use Spark SVGs as reference images
2. Feed to image generation AI (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
3. Generate animation frame variations
4. Compile into APNG files

## Estimated Effort

| Phase | Task | Effort | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Complete** | Design & configuration | 6-8 hours | ✅ Done |
| **Pending** | APNG animation creation | 16-20 hours | 2-3 days (manual) |
| **Pending** | Testing & refinement | 4-6 hours | 1 day |
| **Pending** | Integration & deployment | 2-4 hours | A few hours |
| | **TOTAL** | **28-38 hours** | **1-2 weeks** |

## Success Criteria

✅ **Design Phase (Complete)**
- [x] Visual design captures playful personality
- [x] Character distinct from robot mascot
- [x] All 13 agent states mapped to animations
- [x] Eye-tracking elements properly structured

⏳ **Animation Phase (Pending)**
- [ ] All 32 animation files created as APNG
- [ ] Frame quality matches design intent
- [ ] Animations loop smoothly without jumps
- [ ] Timing feels responsive and natural

⏳ **Integration Phase (Pending)**
- [ ] theme.json loads without errors
- [ ] All state transitions work correctly
- [ ] Eye-tracking follows cursor smoothly
- [ ] Click/drag reactions trigger properly
- [ ] Sleep sequence completes correctly
- [ ] Mini mode peeking works as designed

---

## Notes

- **SVG Quality:** The 8 base SVGs are production-ready and can be used as animation keyframes
- **Color Accuracy:** All colors are specified in hex; verify consistency when exporting
- **Eye Tracking:** Only idle state should use SVG for eye-tracking; others should be static APNGs
- **Frame Timing:** Typical animation speed is 100-150ms per frame (6-10 fps) for smooth loops
- **Asset Optimization:** APNG files should be optimized to keep theme size reasonable (<5MB total)

---

## Next Action

**To continue:**

1. Create APNG animation files from the SVG keyframes
2. Deploy to `themes/spark/assets/`
3. Test theme loading in clawd-on-desk
4. Verify each state displays and transitions correctly

See **ANIMATION_GUIDE.md** for detailed frame creation instructions.
