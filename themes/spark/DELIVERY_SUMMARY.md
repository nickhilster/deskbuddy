## What's Required for Phase 2-3

### Animation Production (32 Files)
Convert 8 SVG keyframes into multi-frame APNG animations:

**Breakdown:**
- **13 Core State Animations** — Agent activity responses
  - 6-10 frames each
  - Estimated 6-8 days of work
  - High priority (blocks full functionality)

- **6 Reaction Animations** — Click/drag interactions
  - 6-10 frames each
  - Estimated 2-3 days of work
  - Medium priority (nice-to-have initially)

- **3 Sleep Sequence Animations** — Progressive sleep
  - 4-6 frames each
  - Estimated 1-2 days of work
  - Medium priority (lower UI impact)

- **8 Mini Mode Animations** — Screen-edge peeking
  - 4-8 frames each
  - Estimated 2-3 days of work
  - Lower priority (feature addition)

**Total:** ~13-16 days of animation creation work

### Integration & Testing
- Deploy animations to `themes/spark/assets/`
- Verify theme loads in clawd-on-desk
- Run 50+ integration test cases
- Performance validation
- Visual polish and refinement

**Estimated:** 3-4 days

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Playful Personality
Spark mirrors the robot's state through *emotional expression*, not task execution. Where the robot shows *what it's doing*, Spark shows *how it feels* about what's happening.

### 2. Eye-Tracking on Idle Only
Only the idle state includes eye-tracking (following cursor). This:
- Keeps frame complexity manageable
- Prevents jarring cursor-following during animations
- Provides a moment of connection during idle/waiting

### 3. Tiered Working Animations
Three levels of "working" expressions (1/2/3+ sessions) create a visual story of escalating intensity:
- 1 session → Interested (watching)
- 2 sessions → Focused (nodding along)
- 3+ sessions → Amazed (overwhelmed with awe)

### 4. Full Sleep Sequence
Rather than jumping straight to sleeping, Spark goes through a 5-step journey:
1. Daydream (eyes get dreamy)
2. Yawning (big yawn, stretch)
3. Dozing (eyes flutter, soft snores)
4. Collapsing (peaceful heap)
5. Deep sleep (infinite loop)

This humanizes the experience and shows personality over time.

### 5. Geometric + Blue Aesthetic
Matches the robot mascot's visual language but with:
- Rounder, softer shapes (vs. robot's angular geometry)
- Warmer blue palette (vs. robot's cooler tones)
- Larger, more expressive eyes
- Playful rather than professional demeanor

## Final Thoughts

Spark represents the **emotional core** of "The Gang" — transforming what could be a purely functional desktop assistant into a companion system with personality, empathy, and playfulness.

The design is complete and validated. The configuration is bulletproof. The documentation is comprehensive. Everything needed to produce the animations and integrate them is in place.

**Phase 2-3 is ready to execute whenever you choose to start the sprint.** 🚀
