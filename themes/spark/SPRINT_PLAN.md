## Overview

This sprint completes the Spark pet companion implementation by:
1. Creating 32 APNG animation files from SVG keyframes
2. Deploying all assets to the theme directory
3. Full integration testing with clawd-on-desk
4. Visual polish and refinement

---

## Sprint 2: Animation Production

### Goal
Create all 32 APNG animation files needed for Spark to be fully functional.

### Breakdown by Animation Type

#### A. Core State Animations (13 files) — 6-8 days
These drive the main emotional responses to agent activity.

| File | Source | Frames | Duration | Complexity | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| thinking-confused.apng | thinking-confused.svg | 6 | 3-5s | Medium | High |
| working-watch.apng | idle + happy | 4-6 | 2-3s | Medium | High |
| working-nod.apng | happy + thinking | 4-6 | 2-3s | Medium | High |
| working-impressed.apng | happy-excited.svg | 8 | 2-3s | High | High |
| juggling-play.apng | playful + happy | 8 | 3-4s | High | High |
| juggling-dizzy.apng | dizzy-overwhelmed.svg | 8 | 3s | High | High |
| notification-alert.apng | happy-excited.svg | 4-6 | 2-3s | Medium | High |
| waking-stretch.apng | sleeping → tired → idle | 5 | 1.5s | Medium | High |
| sweeping-tidy.apng | idle + playful | 6 | 2-4s | Medium | Medium |
| carrying-proud.apng | happy + playful | 6 | 3-5s | Medium | Medium |

| sleeping.apng | sleeping.svg | 6 | Loop | Medium | High |

**Daily Goal:** Create 2-3 animations per day

#### B. Reaction Animations (6 files) — 2-3 days
User interaction responses (click/drag).

| File | Trigger | Frames | Duration | Complexity |
|------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| react-left-cheeky.apng | Double-click left | 6 | 2.5s | Medium |
| react-right-cheeky.apng | Double-click right | 6 | 2.5s | Medium |
| react-flail.apng | 4 rapid clicks | 10 | 3s | High |
| react-drag-playful.apng | Drag (any) | 6-8 | Variable | Medium |
| react-drag-left.apng | Drag left | 6 | Variable | Medium |
| react-drag-right.apng | Drag right | 6 | Variable | Medium |

**Daily Goal:** Create 2-3 animations per day

#### C. Sleep Sequence (3 files) — 1-2 days
Progressive sleep journey (yawn → doze → collapse → sleep).

| File | Stage | Frames | Duration | Complexity |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| yawning.apng | 1 (start sleep) | 6 | 3s | Medium |
| dozing.apng | 2 (middle sleep) | 6 | Loop | Medium |
| collapsing.apng | 3 (collapse) | 4 | 0.8s | Low |

**Daily Goal:** Create 1-2 per day

#### D. Mini Mode Animations (8 files) — 2-3 days
Screen-edge peeking behaviors.

| File | Behavior | Frames | Complexity |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| mini-idle-peek.apng | Peeking from corner | 6 | Low |
| mini-look.apng | Glancing around | 4 | Low |
| mini-alert-excited.apng | Jumps excitedly | 6 | Medium |

| mini-enter-bounce.apng | Bounces onto screen | 6 | Medium |
| mini-peek.apng | Subtle peek | 4 | Low |
| mini-crabwalk.apng | Scuttles across | 8 | High |
| mini-sleep-cozy.apng | Sleeping in corner | 4 | Low |

**Daily Goal:** Create 2-3 per day

#### E. Audio (2 files) — Optional
- spark-complete.mp3
- spark-confirm.mp3

### Animation Creation Workflow

**Step 1: Frame Design (per animation)**
```
1. Load source SVG(s) as reference
2. Create frame variations:
   - Frame 1 (start position)
   - Frames 2-N (intermediate positions with eye/mouth/body changes)
   - Frame N (end position, should loop smoothly back to Frame 1)
3. Ensure consistent styling (colors, line weights, proportions)
4. Save as numbered PNG sequence (frame-01.png, frame-02.png, etc.)
```

**Step 2: APNG Compilation**
```bash
# Using ffmpeg (recommended)
ffmpeg -framerate 10 -pattern_type glob -i "animation-frames/*.png" \
  -c:v libopng -pred mixed output.apng

# Or use ezgif.com for manual compilation
```

**Step 3: Verification**
- [ ] Animation loops smoothly (no jump at end)
- [ ] Timing feels natural and responsive
- [ ] Colors match design palette (#4A90E2, #6BA3F5, etc.)
- [ ] File size < 500KB per animation

### Tools & Resources

**Recommended:**
- **Aseprite** — Professional pixel/vector animation (paid, ~$20)
- **GIMP + Script-Fu** — Free, scriptable frame generation
- **ffmpeg** — Free command-line APNG generation
- **ezgif.com** — Free online APNG maker (drag-and-drop frames)

**Alternative:**
- Blender (3D → frame export)
- Krita (free digital painting with animation)
- ImageMagick (programmatic frame generation)

### Daily Standup Template

```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Animations Created: [count]
Files: [list]
Blockers: [any issues?]
Tomorrow's Plan: [which animations]
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Animation creation takes longer than estimated | Work on high-priority animations first; fall back to static frames if needed | Dev |
| APNG compatibility issues | Test on multiple browsers/OSes; have GIF fallback ready | QA |
| Eye-tracking doesn't work smoothly | Verify SVG element IDs; adjust tracking math if needed | Dev |
| Performance degradation | Profile CPU/memory; optimize frame sizes | Dev |
| Color inconsistency | Use color samples from design file; batch-check all files | QA |
